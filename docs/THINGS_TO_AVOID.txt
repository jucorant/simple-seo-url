As of now, SSU insert identifiers to check if the link is a category page, or a product info page, and to check the product type of the product.

So, make sure that none of your defined page has these in its name:
DELIMITERcDELIMITER
DELIMITERpDELIMITER
DELIMITERmDELIMITER
DELIMITERgDELIMITER
DELIMITERdDELIMITER
DELIMITERfDELIMITER

DELIMITER can be set in admin as either "-" or "_", so for example, if you chose "-" (default) you should avoid:
-c-
-p-
-m-
-g-
-d-
-f-

It's also smart to avoid those in your query string.
But don't worry too much, I'm 100% sure that the default ZC does not have these, and all add-on modules I have seen so far do not have these as well.

You do NOT have to avoid those in your category/product names, they will be automatically removed when used in links.
